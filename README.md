# Algorithmic Data Cleaning with Pandas
Algorithmic accumulator that walks arrays right (reduceRight) while handling conditions without mutations to variables, no loops, and zero non deterministic code design patterns.

---------------------------------------------------------

#### The Challenge
There are 2 datasources: ```input/Task_Data_1.csv``` and ```input/Task_Data_1.csv```. Each data source has ```item_id``` that can be used to association between both sources. 

You need to compile 2 files in one output file (csv). Resulting structure and rules of transformation:
